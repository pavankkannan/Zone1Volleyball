                        Passing is the first skill any volleyball player should learn. The difference between a good passer and a bad one can decide roster spots, rotation formations, the effectiveness of attacks, and more. Liberos and Defensive Specialists are often the best passers on a team, but Outsides, Setters, and Opposites are also expected to pass at a high level. There are plenty of volleyball players who have top-tier hitting, serving, or blocking, but without good passing, they will struggle to find playing time on the court, making it the one of the most important skills in the game.
                        <br><br>
                        The action of passing can be broken down into four main components, footwork, platform, contact, and post-contact. Each part plays a major role in becoming a consistent passer.
                        <br><br>
                        After mastering the two basic types of passes, forearm, and overhead, learning more advanced techniques, like penguin diving, pancaking, and one handed passing, can help you dig more powerful balls.

                        Before learning how to make a platform, or how to make contact with the ball, footwork is essential in making sure you put yourself in the best possible situation. Although many top players often pass with imperfect stances and footwork, they have hundreds of thousands of reps passing a ball, and thus, the experience that comes with it. Good footwork and positioning creates good habits and puts you in more advantageous spots for better ball control.
                        <br><br>
                        The athletic stance is a “ready-like” position that is used in many sports, with the primary goal being to put someone in a spot to make sudden movements. For example, when football players are hunched over waiting for a play to start, they are using their athletic stance so they can get off the line and get moving as soon as possible. In soccer, the goalkeeper keeps their knees bent and their hands out, waiting for other players to shoot the ball, so they can be ready to dive and make a save. Volleyball is no exception, as players have to move, dive, and react to balls moving downwards at super fast speeds. The athletic stance tenses your muscles, bracing them for those sudden movements. In other words, it helps you get ready to move your body in a quick, efficient way.
                        <br><br>
                        To get into an athletic stance, start by standing up straight. Bend your knees at an angle until they are about halfway between a sitting and standing position. Once you get more experience passing, you can experiment with different angles, finding one that strikes the best balance for your abilities. Some players get closer to the ground when they are ready to pass a spike, and stand higher up when the ball is easier to pass, but it takes time to learn what works best for you. The end result should look somewhat like a squat, but with less depth. 
                        <br><br>
                        Next, focus on your feet. Keep them a little more than shoulder width apart, as it will help you move from side to side faster. In order to make the split second bodily movements needed to pass, avoid keeping your feet flat footed. Some people call this “being on your toes”, as you want to balance your weight primarily on your forefoot, which includes your toes and the balls of your feet. Combined with your squat-like position, it may feel weird and difficult to balance, but you can practice and perfect your athletic stance pretty much anywhere, so take some time to practice and perfect your form.
                        <br><br>
                        The last key component of the athletic stance is your arms. Instead of keeping them by your side, hold them out with your palms and forearms facing each other. This puts them in range to quickly make a platform for either passing or setting. In general, you shouldn’t have your hands connected to pass, or ready to set, until a few moments before you make contact with the ball. The reason is moving towards the ball with your hands interlocked or in a setting position is generally slower and less accurate. When your hands are already together, you are trying to find the ball, rather than letting the ball fall to you, resulting in you missing, or passing inaccurately. Waiting a little longer and tracking the ball’s trajectory is a more reliable and consistent way for your arms and ball to meet, giving you better control of your passing.
                        <br><br>
                        After practicing your athletic stance for a bit, and getting used to the position, you can practice moving around. The goal of your movements is to get “under the ball” or in a spot to pass the ball with your arms straight out in front of you. For beginners, practice shuffling, and moving forwards and backwards in your athletic stance (more advanced techniques like diving are covered later on!). Shuffling is pretty straightforward, and you may have already learned it previously. To shuffle to the right, push off your left foot, and vice versa. It's better to make smaller, micro shuffles so you don’t overstep and miss the ball. When moving forwards and backwards, taking bigger steps is likely easier, but it is important to always match your steps. If you move forward with your right foot, move the same amount with your left foot to keep your stance balanced. Passing off balance is an important skill, but one that is learned with practice. While practicing moving around, make sure to keep in your athletic stance, with your knees shoulder width apart and bent, your weight balanced on the balls of your feet, and your arms in front of you ready to make a platform.

                        Typically when people refer to passing, they are talking about bump passing, although it may also be called a forearm pass. It is often used for receiving opposing spikes or ball trajectories that are moving more downward, due to its lower contact point and general sturdiness. A player can create a platform for passing by laying their arms flat and connecting their hands together. Then, by swinging their arms in a controlled manner, the ball is moved upwards towards their target.

                    <p class="articleText">
                        To make a platform for bump passing, first lay your arms out in front of you with your palms facing up. This allows you to use the flatter, wider part of your forearm, which is best for consistent passing trajectories. Next, place one hand over the other, (right over left if you are right handed, and vice versa) with your fingers overlapping. Then, close your hands and lock your platform by folding your thumbs over so they touch. The result should be a flat, sturdy area for the ball to make contact with. Generally you should make your platform once you are under the ball, knowing where it will land. Make sure to stay in your athletic stance while you make your platform!

                        Once you’ve made your platform, you are ready to make contact with the ball. Angle your arms so that your platform slopes slightly downwards, but not too much. When the ball finally makes contact with your arms, still in your athletic stance, freeze briefly in order to cushion it and remove any spin it might have had. Once the ball is fully on your platform, using the power of your athletic stance, push up, straightening your knees until they are just slightly bent. This generates a controlled power that moves the ball upward. To get more power, swing your platform upwards in a brief, calm movement. Swinging too wildly will make the movement of the ball more unpredictable and harder for the next player to get to. You should “push” with your platform, rather than change its angle. Follow through with this form until the ball has fully left your platform, then get back into your athletic stance in case the ball comes back to you!

                        Hand passing, or overhead passing, is used for slower moving, or flatter trajectory balls because of its higher contact point compared to bumps. For many players, hand passing is more intuitive, allowing for better precision and aiming. The technique is somewhat straightforward, with players cushioning the ball with their fingers briefly, then pushing out in the direction of their target. The movement is very similar to setting, but without many of its restrictive rules, making overhand passing more generally more forgiving.

                        Just like with your passing platform, wait until you are close to making contact with the ball before putting your hands out. The hand passing “platform” is simply created by putting your hands up, close together, slightly cupped. Your hands should start above your head, with elbows bent and flaring outwards. The most important thing to remember before making contact with the ball is: Strong Hands! Contact with the ball is very quick, and if you don't focus on keeping your arms and hands sturdy, the ball will fly right through your fingertips.

                        Once you’ve readied your platform and braced your hands for impact, making contact with the ball is straightforward. When the ball gets to your fingertips, push upwards and forwards with your arms, straightening out your previously bent elbows. Although the motion is similar to setting, the rules regarding overhead passing are much more relaxed. You can “double” or contact the ball twice briefly, meaning you can focus on getting the ball up instead of contacting it perfectly. However, refs may still call lifts or carries if you move the ball too slowly, or cup the ball too much, so still try to keep your contact brief. For slower moving balls, you might need to get out of your athletic stance to get enough power to move the ball farther, but after you finish passing, get back into your stance and be ready for the next ball!

                        The main goal of passing is to get the ball up for the next player. That player is often the setter, and they stand towards the right side of the court. This means when you pass, you should be aiming upwards and forwards, but also slightly to the right. A perfect pass means the setter won’t have to move from their starting spot, which can lead to better sets, and better hits. There are plenty of other scenarios where you might need to be more precise with your passing aim, and to do this, angling your platform and finishing towards your target are crucial techniques. 
                        <br><br>
                        Platform angling happens before and while you are contacting the ball. Just what it sounds like, instead of your platform being straight, slightly tilt your platform in the direction you want to pass the ball towards. When you contact the ball, be sure that both arms are still touching the ball, otherwise, it might fly off in an unintended direction. After that, as the ball is leaving your platform, keep your platform pointed in the direction of your target. 
                        <br><br>
                        Your footwork is another factor in aiming your passes. When passing to your right, have your left foot about a step in front of your right. This creates an imbalance that tilts your body to face the right, helping your passes go in that direction. To pass to your left, have your right foot a step in front of the left for the same effect.

                        Once you’ve mastered the basics of passing, you can start learning more advanced skills, specifically, ones that help you dig the ball. In volleyball, a dig is a pass that keeps an opponent’s spike in play. They can be as simple as passing a spike aimed directly at you, or as difficult as diving across the floor, stretching your arm out to get any part of your body on the ball. The latter is the kind of skills focused on in this section.                    </p>

Diving on hardwood is potentially dangerous for beginners, so practicing on a mat or softer surface is recommended before making the transition to a court.
